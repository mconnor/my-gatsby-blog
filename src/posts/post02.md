# Netflix - Messiah

Just started binging Messiah on Netflix. I have no idea where it's going but suspenseful and I love the location shots.

The lead - the messiah - has good looking rock star looks and is pretty intense. Which makes sense for the roll I suppose.  .  The Israeli agent reminds me of a dark version of a friend of mine.
